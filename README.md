# CRUD-groceries-seller web app


This is a froentend webapp that uses  CRUD(CREATE-READ-UPDATE-DELETE) operations to perform various kinds of work.

I have used React js for the froentend , and Recoil for state management

**note: this app doesn't has a backend . Its just a front-end prototype . I will soon update this repo with a  full stack version of this app
